#### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Update the `.env` file with your credentials:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<your-username>:<your-password>@cluster0.mongodb.net
   PORT=4000
   JWT_SECRET=yourSecretKey
   NODE_ENV='development'

   SMTP_USER='your-brevo-username'
   SMTP_PASS='your-brevo-password'
   SENDER_EMAIL='your-email@example.com'
   ```
5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

#### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the `client` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Update the `.env` file with the backend URL:
   ```
   VITE_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:4000"
   ```
5. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
